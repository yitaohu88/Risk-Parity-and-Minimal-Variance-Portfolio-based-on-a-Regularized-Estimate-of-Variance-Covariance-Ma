# Risk-Parity-and-Minimal-Variance-Portfolio-based-on-a-Regularized-Estimate-of-Variance-Covariance-Ma
Estimated the Covariance Matrix with the LedoitWolf and Diagonalization shrinkage methods, significantly reducing the out-of-sample estimating errors Constructed a risk parity and a minimum-variance portfolio using Convex optimization and nested clustered optimization algorithm 
Backtested the risk parity and minimum-variance portfolios with monthly rebalancing and 49 industry portfolios as asset universe, improving the Sharpe Ratio from 0.23 (no shrinkage) to 0.63Â
